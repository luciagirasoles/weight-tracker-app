  - **DRY-code (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**
    - Does the code repeats itself?
    - Is the code clean and easy to understand?
    - Is the code maintainable by another person?
  - **Code review:** You are required to provide at least 2 code reviews to your team members. Please organize with your team for who is doing review of whom, so no one is left hanging.
    - Has the student code reviewed at least 2 pull request from their team?
    - Is the feedback valuable and insightful?
    - Did the exchange spar positive discussion and make the codebase better?
  - **Pull requests:** Your PR is not just about pushing code, but also a communication tool with your team.
